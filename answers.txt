Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.3

Problem 3:
 
File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

By commenting out the assignment, linenum = 0, 
it causes a name error in line 40 because the program 
is trying to reference the variable, linenum, that is undefined.

By commenting out gc_count = 0, the same type of name error occurs 
because gc_count is undefined.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

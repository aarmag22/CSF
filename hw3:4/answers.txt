Homework 3 and 4

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Corrected GC_content: 0.430599870611 
(new figure uses sum_count rather than total_count for calculation)

Problem 3:
 
File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

By commenting out the assignment, linenum = 0, 
it causes a name error in line 40 because the program 
is trying to reference the variable, linenum, that is undefined.

By commenting out gc_count = 0, the same type of name error occurs 
because gc_count is undefined.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.568993851852

Corrected AT-content: 0.569400129389

Problem 5:

A-count: 7701287
C-count: 5879128
G-count: 5738773
T-count: 7661547

Problem 6:

The results generated by the dna analysis program show that for all except one 
of the .fastq files there is a descrepancy between the sum count, the total 
count and the seq length. The test-small.fastq file was the only one where all 
3 totals were the same. For each of the other .fastq files the total count and 
seq lenght were equal but the sum count was less. When I examined the contents 
of the files I found that the test-small.fastq contained only A's, C's, G's, and 
T's whereas all the other files contain some N's. The reason for the discrepancy 
is because the sum count adds the count of all the A's, C's, G's, and T's but 
the total count and the seq length accounts for all the letters in the file so 
since all but the test-small.fastq contain some N's the totals are different.
The sum count is the figure that should be used to accurately calculate the 
GC-content.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content
